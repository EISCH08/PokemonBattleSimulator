# Text-Based Pokemon Battle Simulator

A Pokemon application that is run in console. I implemeted the first 300mons with their 
-Moveset
-ExpGrowth
-DexNumber
-Type
-StatGrowth

Allowed the player to battle against a computer AI

This AI is based off of the AI in the franchise Pokemon games.

This application was never finished 100%, I plan on going back to it because I have developed as a programmer since my first attempt

## What I Learned
 - Parse CSV Files
 - Game implemetation
 - Basic implementation of an artificial intelligence
